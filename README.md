## Background
A kanban board is an system used to visualise tasks in a production pipeline. Tasks are arranged in columns according to their current status such as 'todo', 'doing' and 'done', columns can be added and named to be more specific to the needs of the team. The board allows the team to track potential bottlenecks in the pipline if too many tasks end sitting in one column. It also allows the team to estimate lead times for tasks in the pipeline.
